Best Practices for File Management

Data Organization and Backup Plan Florida Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI)

Objective: To outline and implement consistent information management procedures for long-term safe-keeping of Agency data.

Overview Â· Data are our legacy to the Agency. The data we collect, manage and analyze today will continue to be available and used by staff in the future. It is, therefore, important to maintain and organize our data in a way that will be useful and meaningful to future users. This includes: o Keeping files organized and up-to-date; o Documenting information about the files and the process(es) for creating the files; and o Cleaning out files (and paperwork) that are not important for the future legacy of the data (e.g. intermediate files, outdated information). Â· A well-designed filing system will: o Make filing and storing information less difficult and tedious; o Offer easier retrieval of information and reduce time spent searching for files; o Ensure the integrity and continuity of record keeping, despite changes in personnel; o Allow for the easy identification and purging of outdated information; o Be uniform in implementation; and o Be expandable and flexible to meet future needs.

Terms What data should be stored? Â· Data storage is costly, in terms of space for storing data, space for backing up data, and time for managing, organizing and documenting data. It is important and expected that you are aware of this as you create files, take photos, or store other data. Â· For projects, these details and expectations may be outlined in some form of documentation. These instructions should be explicitly followed for long-term consistency within the project. Â· For other work where these details may not be outlined, it is up to you to organize, manage, document and/or purge the data and files you create as appropriate.

The following are recommended best practices for data and information storage on shared network drives, external hard drives and staff computers.

Where should data be stored? Â· Shared Drive (\\fwc-spfs1)Common) (\\fwc-spfs2) Administration): o Files on this server are backed up via the FWRI back-up procedures as follows: Â§ Monday Evening â€“ Thursday â€“ differential backup (definition page 7) Â§ Friday Evening â€“ full backup (takes multiple days). Any work being done on Saturday or Sunday will be backed up on Monday evening, so does have the potential to be lost. Â§ The Monthly Tapes are sent to Tallahassee for storage (13 month retention). Weekly tapes are here in the building kept in a hardened, water proof case and can easily be carried out of the office in case of emergency. o Place files in these drives for backup purposes. o Remove files from these locations once they are no longer needed or do not need to be shared or retained Â· Shared Drive (\\fwc-spfs1 Scratch) o This drive is not backed up on a regular basis. This shared space is for temporary work only. Â· Individual field station servers: o Files that need to be accessed locally by field station staff; files on these servers are backed up via the FWRI back-up procedures described above. Â§ (\\fwc-chfs1) Port Charlotte Â§ (\\fwc-ckfs2) Cedar Key Â§ (\\fwc-irfs2) Indian River Â§ (\\fwc-jxfs2) Jacksonville University Â§ (\\fwc-mtfs2) Marathon, FL Â§ (\\fwc-nafs1) Naples, FL Â§ (\\fwc-pmfs2) Port Manatee Â§ (\\fwc-tqfs1) Tequesta Â§ (\\fwc-gvfs1) Gainesville Field Lab o *NOTE* For most computers configured for field station use, these servers are listed as a specific letter drive. Example: Drive (G) is listed as â€˜fwc-chfs1â€™ for staff in Port Charlotte and as â€˜fwc-pmfs2â€™ for staff in Port Manatee. The letter drive is arbitrary. You can determine what drive letter your server is connecting to by opening a Windows Explorer window and clicking on â€˜Computerâ€™ in the left hand column. Â· User folders (\\fwc-spfs1\users\[lastname_firstinitial\]) Typically the U: drive on your computer o Files that are only being used by the individual user; o Files in this location are backed up via normal FWRI back-up procedures. Â· Desktop PCs (Local Drive ) o Files that are only being used by the individual user and are on the local PC/Laptop o Files in this location are to be backed up by the individual user on external hard drive or memory stick on a regular basis. Staff can use Windows backup (to learn how to do this Google â€œHow to Back up your filesâ€) based on your current Windows version or by using the backup software contained on most external hard drives. Â· External hard drives: backups of your important files from any location. You may consider storing these devices off-site when you are not in the office.

How should data be stored? Â· Folder structure recommendations: o Create folders with a top-down hierarchy, i.e. folders should get more specific as you get deeper into folder organization. This will make long-term organization more efficient, will consolidate files to a layout that will be easy for others to interpret, and will improve information transfer among staff. Â§ Weak File Structure (DONâ€™T): Â· C:\\FirstName.LastName \DataRequest\_20150101 \MortalityDataUpdates \Request\_12DEC2014 \Shoreline \TemperatureFigures2 \TemperatureFigures*v1 Â§ Better file structure (DO or consider some variation that works best for you): Â· C:\\FirstName.LastName* \DataRequests \Genetics*20141212* \Genetics*20150101* \GIS \Shoreline \Projects \Mortality \DataUpdates \TemperatureProbe \Figures*v01* \Figures*v02 o For files on your computer: Â§ Create a folder for your files in the root of your C:\\ named FirstName.LastName or FirstName_LastName (e.g. C:\\Joe.Scientist). Store all your working files within this folder. Note that this is different from the default file storage location (C:*\Users\firstname.lastname\Documents or Libraries\Documents) Â§ When you store files in your Windows-generated userâ€™s folder (or on your desktop), other staff are not able to access these files without logging in with your account. Emergencies happen, so keep your files accessible. Â§ Try to keep a clean desktop. If you are using your desktop for easily accessing files, create shortcuts on your desktop rather than keeping the file on your desktop. o For directories on the server, use the following general folder structure for each project subfolder. Not all projects will be able to fit this mold, but this structure will help keep data organized across multiple projects. Analysis\[description\] â€“ for projects with multiple analyses, creating subfolders for each analysis may be helpful for better organizing data; within the analysis folder, the data, docs, GIS, metadata, scripts general directory structure can be used for consistency in data storage. Data â€“ contains data collected in numerous formats, including databases, spreadsheets, etc. Docs â€“ contains project proposals, reports, processing manuals, original field data sheets, etc. GIS â€“ spatial data and programs associated with the project. *NOTE* If your GIS data are too large to be placed on a shared server, be sure to logically organize the file structure so that others will be able to determine folder contents. Consider adding a README.txt file describing where those files reside (i.e. personal computer or external hard drive with complete folder structure location: C:\firstname.lastname\GIS\data\shoreline\â€™file_nameâ€™). Metadata â€“ copies of finalized metadata records and other metadata documentation, organized as needed. *NOTE* Should your metadata files be stored in a location other than with the actual data itself, the name of your metadata files should match those of the data files that the metadata represents. Scripts â€“ not GIS-specific; e.g. R script files. Contents\[FolderName\]\[yyyymmdd\].docx â€“ an explanatory README.txt file describing the contents of this project folder (with the date in the file name referring to the date the contents document was last updated). Â· File naming conventions: o Use project- or task-specific file naming conventions, when specified, for consistency and efficient sorting (e.g. vehicle logs, temperature probe data files). o File names should be unique, simple, and easy to understand. Â§ DONâ€™T: Plan 1.docx Â§ DO: Project_DataMgmtPlan_v01.docx o Use underscores () to represent spaces. Avoid using spaces. This is a best practice as spaces will break hyperlinks in an address string. Â§ DONâ€™T: Section Data Management Plan.docx Â§ DO: Project_DataMgmtPlan_2015_01_01.docx o Use only alpha-numeric characters. Special characters (e.g.: ? ! / \$ % \# \< \>) are often reserved for use by the operating system. If you need files to sort at the top of a list, precede with an underscore (). Preceding with an underscore should only be for personal file management and not for final document names or documents that are shared with others. Â§ DONâ€™T: !Project_DataMgmtPlan_v01.docx Â§ DO: *Project_DataMgmtPlan_v01.docx o Use leading zeros with the numbers 0-9 to facilitate proper sorting and file management. Â§ DONâ€™T: Project_DataMgmtPlan_v1.docx Â§ DO: Project_DataMgmtPlan_v01.docx o Dates should be used in file names in the year* month \_day order to maintain chronological order. Â§ DONâ€™T: 01JAN2015 or 1-1-2015 Â§ DO: 20150101 or 2015_01_01 o Keep the file name as short as possible Â§ DONâ€™T: Project_DataMgmtPlan_OtherExtraneousInformation Â§ DO: Project_DataMgmtPlan.docx o Using versioning to track different version of your file. This can either be by including the version number in the file name by using â€˜vâ€™ or â€˜Vâ€™ and the version number at the end of the document or the date of the file with your initials/last name or some combination of the two. Â§ Not all files will need versioning. Use versioning when it is important to track changes on some interval, when you are sharing files with others and when it may be important later. Discard obsolete versions once backups are made and/or they are no longer needed. Â§ Avoid unclear names like last, final2, final revised, etc. Â§ In Word, you can use the â€œlast saved dateâ€ within a document (either at the top of the file or in the header/footer) to help keep track of the most current version. This can be added and tracked automatically: INSERT menu \> Quick Parts \> Fieldâ€¦ \> Date and Time Category \> SaveDate. Â§ VERSION â€“ avoid putting the version or draft at the beginning of the file name to maintain a helpful sorting order. Â· DONâ€™T: v1_Project_DataMgmtPlan.docx Â· DO: Project_DataMgmtPlan_v01.docx Â§ DATE and INITIALS/LASTNAME â€“ this is often a helpful tracking method when you are sharing a file with other staff. Put the date before your initials to maintain a helpful sorting order. Â· DONâ€™T: Project_DataMgmtPlan_Stacie_1JAN2015.docx Â· DO: Project_DataMgmtPlan_20150101_ABC.docx o Order the pieces of information or elements being used to create the file name in the most logical order based on retrieval methods and generally from most general to most specific. Â§ DONâ€™T: Cause of death specific questions â€“ 1Jan2015 â€“ Mortality 2009-2013.doc Â§ DO: Mortality_2009-2013_CauseOfDeathQuestions_20150101.doc Whatâ€™s next? Â· For new staff o Take time to set up a filing system that will work for you. Â· For departing staff o Go through your files: Â§ Clean out any information that no longer needs to be kept; Â§ Organize and document what does need to be kept. o Meet with your supervisor to go through files prior to your last day. Â· For all staff: o Review data management plan annually in June. o Throughout the year, staff are expected to implement sound data management practices, as outlined in this document. Regular review â€“ at a minimum once year o CHECK EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES to make sure they are working properly. This includes connecting them to the computer and checking that you can read/write files to this device. All external hard drives that are not regularly accessed should be checked regularly. Â· PURGE â€“ clean out files and other items that have reached the end of their retention period or are considered obsolete. For the FWC Records Retention Policy and Schedules please refer to our portal site: http://portal2/records/SitePages/Home.aspx o This may apply to any of the following: Â· Documents Â· Transitional or temporary data stored on external hard drives Â· Grant Files â€“ Some awards may require that we retain records for â€œxâ€ amount of years. o Official Grant reports (Quarterly, bi-annual, annual, final) submitted to grantors through the Grants office are retained/archived by the Grants office. o Other files pertaining to grants that are not submitted through the grants office, please refer to the FWC record retention policies. Â· Other Reports â€“ If a report does not fall into any of the FWC specific record retention policies, check within your supervisor for any Section specific report retention requirements. If needed, burn old reports to CD/DVD for storage. Â· Email â€“ All email communication is retained on our cloud exchange servers (even the email that you delete from your personal @MyFWC.com account).

Glossary of Terms

Backup - is the result of copying or archiving files and folders for the purpose of being able to restore them in case of data loss

Type Definition Benefits Drawbacks Full Backup: A complete backup of everything you want to backup. Usually done once when first setting up a backup strategy. Restoration is fast, since you only need one set of backup data. The backing up process is slow. High storage requirements. Differential Backup: The backup software looks at which files have changed since you last did a full backup. Then creates copies of all the files that are different from the ones in the full backup.

If you do a differential backup more than once, it will copy all the files, or parts of files that have changed since the last full backup, even if you already have identical copies of those files in a previous differential backup.

For restoring all the data, you will only need the last full backup, and the last differential backup. Faster to create than a full backup.

Restoration is faster than using incremental backup.

Not as much storage needed as in a full backup. Restoration is slower than using a full backup.

Creating a differential backup is slower than creating an incremental backup. Incremental Backup: The backup software creates copies of all the files, or parts of files that have changed since previous backups of any type (full, differential or incremental).

For example if you did a full backup on Sunday. An incremental backup made on Monday, would only contain files changed since Sunday, and an incremental backup on Tuesday, would only contain files changed since Monday, and so on. This method is the fastest when creating a backup.

The least storage space is needed. Restoring from incremental backups is the slowest because it may require several sets of data to fully restore all the data. For example if you had a full backup and six incremental backups. To restore the data would require you to process the full backup and all six incremental backups.

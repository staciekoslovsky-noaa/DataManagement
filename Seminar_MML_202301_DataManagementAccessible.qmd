## Overview {.smaller}

Data are our legacy.

The data we collect, manage and analyze today will continue to be available and used by staff in the future. It is, therefore, important to maintain, organize and share our data in a way that will be useful and meaningful to current-us and future-us. This includes:

-   Keeping files organized and up-to-date

-   Documenting information about the files and the process(es) for creating the files

But, data storage is costly, in terms of space for storing data, space for backing up data, and time for managing, organizing and documenting data, so...

*We want to be mindful in our data management strategies and application*.

## NOAA Data Strategy {.smaller}

From 2020 NOAA Data Strategy: "Data are at the heart of NOAA's \$5 billion per year enterprise. ... NOAA data are a critical strategic asset used to ensure accountability, manage operations, and to maintain and enhance the performance of the economy, public health, and welfare."

-   **Goal 1**: Align data management leadership roles across the organization.

-   **Goal 2**: Govern and manage data strategically to most effectively steward the US taxpayers' investment.

-   **Goal 3**: Share data as openly and widely as possible to promote maximum utilization of NOAA data.

-   **Goal 4**: Promote data innovation and quality improvements to facilitate science and support data-driven decision making.

-   **Goal 5**: Engage stakeholders and leverage partnerships to maximize the value of NOAA data to the Nation.

## Ideally... {.smaller}

A well-designed data management system will:

-   Make archiving and storing information less difficult and tedious;

-   Offer easier retrieval of information and reduce time spent searching for files or data;

-   Ensure the integrity and continuity of record keeping, despite changes in personnel;

-   Allow for the easy identification and purging of outdated information;

-   Be foundational;

-   Be uniform in implementation; and

-   Be expandable and flexible to meet future needs.

## Plan {.smaller}

-   Start your project and research off with good planning and design.

-   Data management is just *one* part of this early planning (and the only focus of this presentation).

-   Early planning takes a lot of work, but working through all these steps from the beginning will save you *so much* time later.

![](Seminar_MML_202301_DataManagementAccessible_files/images/planning.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Plan {.smaller}

**Things to consider:**

-   What data will be generated? What data need to be gathered from other places (within your program, within MML, from outside sources)?

-   Where will data for the project be stored (on the network, in a database, on Google Drive, etc.)?

    -   How will the data be organized? What does the folder structure look like? How will files be named?

    -   What does the database structure look like? How will data be entered or imported?

-   How will information about the data be preserved? (meeting notes, important decisions, etc.)

-   How will the data move through all the subsequent steps (collection, assurance, description, preservation, discovery, integration and analysis)?

-   Who is responsible for doing what? (an important one!)

## Plan: Folder Organization Ideas {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .smaller width="70%"}
-   Consider how to organize folders (by date, project, species).

-   Create folders with a top-down hierarchy.

-   If you're going to do a big reorganization, consider deleting and archiving things first.

-   For program-wide efforts, work together as a team to come up with different ways to store data, test out some mock-ups, and settle on a solution that works best for the group.

-   Don't store final data only on your laptop!

-   Establish a system for version control (e.g. file-naming, Git). Not everything needs version control. Delete obsolete versions of files.

-   Organize images separately.

-   Maintain whatever system you come up with -- check in, adjust it, and clean it up annually.

## Plan: File Naming {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/documents.png)
:::

::: {.column width="67%"}
File names ideally describe the project, file contents, location, and date, and should be unique enough to stand alone as file descriptions.

File names should be:

-   Human-readable

-   Machine-readable

-   Plays well with default ordering (!)

    -   This may mean different solutions for different projects/reasons.
    -   Order by date, number, name, etc.

Order the pieces of information or elements being used to create the file name in the most logical order based on retrieval methods and generally from most general to most specific.
:::
:::

## Plan: File Naming Conventions {.smaller}

-   File names should be unique, simple, and easy to understand.

-   Use underscores (\_) to represent spaces. Avoid using spaces. This is a best practice as spaces will break hyperlinks in an address string.

-   Use only alpha-numeric characters.

    -   Special characters (e.g.: ? ! / \$ % \# \< \>) are often reserved for use by the operating system.

    -   If you need files to sort at the (very) top of a list, precede with an underscore (\_).

-   Keep the file name as short as possible.

-   Use leading zeros with the numbers 0-9 to facilitate better sorting.

-   Dates should formatted to maintain chronological order (YYYYMMDD).

-   Avoid unclear names like last, final2, final revised, etc.

## Plan: Google Drive

Oof, Google Drive.

There are two camps here (and I've highlighted some considerations for each):

-   Let your files be (exist wherever they exist) and share as-needed

    -   Requires little to no folder organization overhead

    -   Relies on the searching functionality within Google Drive to find things (pro and con)

-   Organize your files like you would a folder structure on the network or on your computer

    -   Simpler for on-boarding new staff (who may not know what to search for)

    -   Can provide a more clear framework for groups working together

    -   More overhead required for managing files

For larger groups (at the program- or project-scale), personally, I'd recommend organizing a centralized folder system and sharing within that, but either way, it's a good conversation to have.

## Plan: Reproducibility

-   Think about how you're going to...
    -   Document your processing

        -   Code is a really nice way to do this.

        -   If that's scary or not in your toolkit, writing down the steps in a (shared) document is also totally okay.

    -   Archive versions of the data used for analyses, if they cannot be otherwise recreated.

## DEIA-related to Data Management {.smaller}

Make data management practices more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible:

-   Target users of all technical backgrounds and develop systems that are accommodating to everyone

    -   Recognize different comfort levels of technology and different ways of processing information
    -   Don't want to leave anyone behind!
    -   Create supportive environment for those struggles/challenges
    -   Make space for different ideas, perspectives, work styles

-   Avoid gate-keeping of ideas, processes, workflows, data

    -   Increase transparency
    -   Think about data management as a complementary process to the research
    -   Work with one another -- all on the same team of trying to move research efforts forward

-   Recognize this work is often un(der)funded and un(der)staffed...and sometimes un(der)recognized

-   Make the information you're presenting accessible (e.g., alt text, colorblindness)

## Reminders {.smaller}

For life and data management:

-   Keep it simple.

-   Start where you are.

-   Not everything has to be a "stretch exercise."

-   Not every project/problem/situation will have the same technology solution. Find and use the best technology for the task at hand.

-   Don't compare yourself to other people.

-   Don't be afraid to try new things or fail the first (or first few times) you try something new.

-   Celebrate your successes!

-   Ask others for help, if you're stuck or want a different perspective.

## Next Steps

-   At least 50% of data management is people management

-   This information can be applied to your individual work or to projects.

    -   For individual files and information, learn from one another!
    -   For projects, this can (and probably should) be a team effort. No one person can likely do all the things. Be clear

-   This presentation may have been a little or a lot of new information for you.

    -   If it was just a little new information for you, you're off to a great start!
    -   If it was a lot of new information for you (and maybe you're feeling overwhelmed with where to start), pick one thing and give it a try.

\<For new staff o Take time to set up a filing system that will work for you. · For departing staff o Go through your files: § Clean out any information that no longer needs to be kept; § Organize and document what does need to be kept. o Meet with your supervisor to go through files prior to your last day. · For all staff: o Review data management plan annually in June. o Throughout the year, staff are expected to implement sound data management practices, as outlined in this document. Regular review – at a minimum once year o CHECK EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES to make sure they are working properly. This includes connecting them to the computer and checking that you can read/write files to this device. All external hard drives that are not regularly accessed should be checked regularly. · PURGE – clean out files and other items that have reached the end of their retention period or are considered obsolete.

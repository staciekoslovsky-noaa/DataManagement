## Overview {.smaller}

Data are our legacy.

The data we collect, manage and analyze today will continue to be available and used by staff in the future. It is, therefore, important to maintain, organize and share our data in a way that will be useful and meaningful to current-us and future-us.

But, data storage is costly, in terms of space for storing data, space for backing up data, and time for managing, organizing and documenting data, and so on...

*We want to be mindful in our data management strategies and application*.

## Ideally... {.smaller}

A well-designed data management system will:

-   Make archiving and storing information less difficult and tedious;

-   Offer easier retrieval of information and reduce time spent searching for files or data;

-   Ensure the integrity and continuity of record keeping, *despite changes in personnel*;

-   Allow for the easy identification and purging of outdated information;

-   Be foundational;

-   Be uniform in implementation; and

-   Be expandable and flexible to meet future needs.

## Plan {.smaller}

-   Start your project and research off with good planning and design.

-   Data management is just *one* part of this early planning (and the only focus of this presentation).

-   Early planning takes a lot of work, but working through all these steps from the beginning will save you *so much* time later.

![](Seminar_MML_202301_DataManagementAccessible_files/images/planning.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Plan: Things to Consider {.smaller}

-   What data will be generated? What data need to be gathered from other places (within your program, within MML, from outside sources)?

-   Where will data for the project be stored (on the network, in a database, on Google Drive, etc.)?

    -   How will the data be organized? What does the folder structure look like? How will files be named?

    -   What does the database structure look like? How will data be entered or imported?

-   How will information about the data be preserved? (meeting notes, important decisions, etc.)

-   How will the data move through all the subsequent steps (collection, assurance, description, preservation, discovery, integration and analysis)?

-   Who is responsible for doing what? (an important one!)

## Plan: Folder Organization Ideas {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .smaller width="70%"}
-   Consider how to organize folders (by date, project, species).

    -   Create folders with a top-down hierarchy.

    -   Organize images separately.

    -   Don't store final data only on your laptop!

-   If you're going to do a big reorganization, consider deleting and archiving things first.

-   For program-wide efforts, work together as a team to come up with different ways to store data, test out some mock-ups, and settle on a solution that works best for the group.

-   Establish a system for version control (e.g. file-naming, Git). Not everything needs version control. Delete obsolete versions of files.

-   Maintain whatever system you come up with -- check in, adjust it, and clean it up annually.

## Plan: File Naming {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/documents.png)
:::

::: {.column .smaller width="67%"}
File names ideally describe the project, file contents, location, and date -- and should be unique enough to stand alone as file descriptions.

*File names should be*:

-   Human-readable

-   Machine-readable

-   Plays well with default ordering (!)

    -   This may mean different solutions for different projects/reasons
    -   Order by date, number, name, etc.
    -   Most general to most specific
:::
:::

## Plan: File Naming Conventions {.smaller}

-   File names should be unique, simple, SHORT, and readable.

-   Avoid using spaces. Alternative ways to break up file naming without spaces: CamelCase, lowerCamelCase, snake_case. CamelCase_PlusSnakeCase.

-   Use only alpha-numeric characters. Avoid special characters.

-   Use leading zeros with the numbers 0-9 for better sorting.

-   Dates should formatted to support logical default ordering.

-   Avoid unclear names like last, final2, final revised, etc.

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png){width="350"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   In data and in folder/file names, dates should formatted to meet ISO 8601 standards

    -   YYYY-MM-DD

    -   YYYYMMDD

    -   YYYY-MM

    -   YYYY-Www (e.g. 2023-W03) if you use week data

    -   Thh:mm:ss.sss (using the 24-hour clock system)

-   We work across time zones, which makes data collection and management particularly complicated. Consider standardizing date/time information to GMT for standardization.
:::
:::

## Plan: Google Drive...oof {.smaller}

There are two camps here (and I've highlighted some considerations for each):

-   Let your files be (exist wherever they exist) and share as-needed

    -   Requires little to no folder organization overhead

    -   Relies on the searching functionality within Google Drive to find things (pro and con)

-   Organize your files like you would a folder structure on the network or on your computer

    -   Simpler for on-boarding new staff (who may not know what to search for)

    -   Can provide a more clear framework for groups working together

    -   More overhead required for managing files

For larger groups (at the program- or project-scale), personally, I'd recommend organizing a centralized folder system and sharing within that, but either way, it's a good conversation to have.

## Plan: Reproducibility {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Think about how you're going to...

-   Document your processing

    -   Code is a really nice way to do this. It also saves you time later, if you have to redo anything.

    -   If that's scary or not in your toolkit, writing down the (detailed) steps in a (shared) document is also totally okay.

-   Archive versions of the data used for analyses, if they cannot be otherwise recreated.

-   Come up with a plan for what you need to do with your data to meet PARR requirements.

## Plan: Take-away Actions {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
**Start Small**

That was a lot of information. Pick one thing that you think would be most beneficial for you to try. Build incrementally. Don't try to do everything all at once or go back through all your older work. Start small with something new(ish).

**Happy Medium**

Work with other members of your program/project to start to bring more of these measures into your work.

**Bring It On!**

Develop a comprehensive data management plan for your project and/or program. Use common planning and structures across program projects. Clean up and reorganize your own/project/program file organization.

## Collect {.smaller}

How you collect data heavily influences down-stream data processing. Set yourself up for success from the beginning!

-   Use consistent methods for collecting data.

    -   Set up a template for data storage.

    -   Use datasheets or cloud-based data recording systems that mirror how data will be stored later.

    -   Use the same format year-to-year, changing as little as possible.

-   Use consistent data organization:

    -   Wide format (spreadsheet format): each row represents a complete entry

    -   Long format (database format): one column defines the parameter and one column stores the value of the parameter

-   Atomize data (make sure there is only one piece of information in each row/column entry). Don't store multiple bits of information in the same field.

-   Keep your raw data raw. Preserve it, imperfections and all.

    -   Use a separate process to clean the data, ideally scripted to make the process reproducible (more to come on this in the Assure section)

    -   Work off the cleaned version of the data.

-   Import raw or manually enter data into a database!

## Assure

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
This is such an easy step to overlook. To me, it is arguably the most important step. But doing it well can take time...

Things to look at in your data:

-   Consistency in values throughout data collection

-   Reasonable min-max, average, range values for each field (query-based or graphically)

-   Missing data

-   Large gaps in data (does this introduce spatial or temporal bias?)

-   Double-checking data that were entered by hand

-   Logical checks

-   Assign quality flags to records to "remove" bad records

Skipping this step can result in catastrophic interpretation of results...

## Describe

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
This is another step that takes a lot of time to do well, but your future self will be really appreciative of your current self doing a thorough job.

-   Describe the data organization

-   Describe who did what and the appropriate contact information

-   Describe the scientific context

-   Describe the data and parameters

This is doesn't just have to be done in InPort. And a reminder, any dataset metadata records created in InPort are required to have their data available online within one year of when the metadata record was created. This does not apply to project-level metadata records (fyi).

## DEIA-related to Data Management {.smaller}

Make data management practices more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible:

-   Target users of all technical backgrounds and develop systems that are accommodating to everyone

    -   Recognize different comfort levels of technology and different ways of processing information
    -   Don't want to leave anyone behind!
    -   Create supportive environment for those struggles/challenges
    -   Make space for different ideas, perspectives, work styles

-   Avoid gate-keeping of ideas, processes, workflows, data

    -   Increase transparency
    -   Think about data management as a complementary process to the research
    -   Work with one another -- all on the same team of trying to move research efforts forward

-   Recognize this work is often un(der)funded and un(der)staffed...

-   Make the information you're presenting accessible (e.g., alt text, colorblindness)

## Reminders {.smaller}

For life and data management:

-   Keep it simple.

-   Start where you are.

-   Not everything has to be a "stretch exercise."

-   Not every project/problem/situation will have the same technology solution. Find and use the best technology for the task at hand.

-   Don't compare yourself to other people.

-   Don't be afraid to try new things or fail the first (or first few times) you try something new.

-   Celebrate your successes!

-   Ask others for help, if you're stuck or want a different perspective.

## Next Steps

-   At least 50% of data management is people management

-   This information can be applied to your individual work or to projects.

    -   For individual files and information, learn from one another!
    -   For projects, this can (and probably should) be a team effort. No one person can likely do all the things. Be clear

-   This presentation may have been a little or a lot of new information for you.

    -   If it was just a little new information for you, you're off to a great start!
    -   If it was a lot of new information for you (and maybe you're feeling overwhelmed with where to start), pick one thing and give it a try.

\<For new staff o Take time to set up a filing system that will work for you. · For departing staff o Go through your files: § Clean out any information that no longer needs to be kept; § Organize and document what does need to be kept. o Meet with your supervisor to go through files prior to your last day. · For all staff: o Review data management plan annually in June. o Throughout the year, staff are expected to implement sound data management practices, as outlined in this document. Regular review – at a minimum once year o CHECK EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES to make sure they are working properly. This includes connecting them to the computer and checking that you can read/write files to this device. All external hard drives that are not regularly accessed should be checked regularly. · PURGE – clean out files and other items that have reached the end of their retention period or are considered obsolete.
